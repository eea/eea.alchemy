Introduction
============
This tool allows Plone managers to auto-discover and fix subject keywords,
location and temporal coverage using http://www.alchemyapi.com/ web service.


Main features
=============

- Auto-discover keywords, locations and temporal coverage;
- Auto highlight keywords within a page content based on selected
  tags and link them to a custom search page;
- Auto update related items based on internal links found within
  object's metadata.


Planed features
===============

- Add a wizard icon near Subject, Location, etc fields in edit form
  to auto-discover and suggest tags based on text in
  other fields (Title, Description)


Install
=======

- Add eea.alchemy to your eggs section in your buildout and re-run buildout. You
  can download a sample buildout from
  https://github.com/collective/eea.alchemy/tree/master/buildouts/plone4
- Install eea.alchemy within Site Setup > Add-ons


Getting started
===============

Auto discover keywords, location, related items or temporal coverage
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Get your alchemy key here: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html
2. Update your alchemy API key within Site Setup > Alchemy Settings
3. Within Plone Control panel go to Alchemy Discoverer.

Auto tagging
------------

1. *Enable auto-tagging* within **Site Setup > Alchemy Settings**
2. Edit your document and add some tags for it within **/edit > Categorization.**
   For example, if you're writing a news article about *water pollution* go to
   **/edit > Categorization** and add *water pollution* within tags field
   (also known as *keywords*, *subjects*, *topics*).
   Now when you navigate to the **View** page of this article,
   you'll notice that all occurrences of *water pollution* within your news
   article body are links to a custom search page which is also configurable
   within **Alchemy Settings ControlPanel**

Auto relations
--------------
1. *Enable auto-relations* within **Site Setup > Alchemy Settings**
2. Edit your document and add some internal links for it
   within **/edit > Body Text.**
   For example, if you're writing an article about an event add a internal link
   to this event within **Body Text** field.
   Now Save your article and you should see a notification message on top of
   the page saying something like: **Automatically detected and added
   one relation since it is linked in content.**
   If you check the related content section for your article you'll notice that
   the Event object was automatically added there.
